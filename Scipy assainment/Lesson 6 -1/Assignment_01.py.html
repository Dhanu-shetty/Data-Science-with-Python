# #### 1: Import required libraries

# In[7]:


import numpy as np
from scipy import linalg


# #### 2: Formulate two linear equations based on the given scenario

# In[9]:


#Use SciPy to solve a linear algebra problem.
#There is a test with 30 questions worth 150 marks. The test has two types of questions:
#1. True or false – carries 4 marks each
#2. Multiple-choice – carries 9 marks each
#Find the number of true or false and multiple-choice questions.

#x + y = 30
#4x + 9y =150

Qestion_number_of_variable = np.array([[1,1],[4,9]])
Qestion_value_of_variable = np.array([30,150])


# 
# #### 3: Apply a suitable method to solve the linear equation
# 

# In[10]:


linalg.solve(Qestion_number_of_variable,Qestion_value_of_variable)


# In[ ]:
