# #### 1: View and add the dataset

# In[3]:


#Import the necessary library
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# In[27]:


#Manually add the Summer Olympics, London 2012 dataset as arrays
country = np.array(["Great Britain" ,"China" , "Russia","United States","Korea","Japan","Germany"])
Country_Code =np.array(["GBR","CHN","RUS","US","KOR","JPN","GER"])
Year = np.array([2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012,2012])
Gold = np.array([29,38,24,46,13,7,11])
Silver = np.array([17,28,25,28,8,14,11])
Bronze  = np.array([19,22,32,29,7,17,14])


# #### Find the country with maximum gold medals

# In[30]:


#Use the argmax() method to find the highest number of gold medals
max_gold = np.argmax(Gold)
max_gold


# In[41]:


#Print the name of the country
country[max_gold]


# #### Find the countries with more than 20 gold medals

# In[43]:


#Use Boolean indexing technique to find the required outpu
size_array = np.size(Gold)
for i in range(size_array):
    if Gold[i] > 20:
        print (country[i])


# #### Evaluate the dataset and print the name of each country with its gold medals and total number of medals

# In[44]:


#Use a for loop to create the required output
for i in range(size_array):
    print (country[i],"has won Gold medels = ",Gold[i],"and total number of medals = ",Gold[i]+Silver[i]+Bronze[i])
